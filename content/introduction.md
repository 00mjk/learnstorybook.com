# Get started

Learn Storybook to create bulletproof UI components as you build an app UI from scratch. This tutorial walks through essential Storybook techniques from working with a single UI component to assembling composite components. Along the way you’ll also learn how to test UI components and deploy Storybook.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is the most popular tool for UI component development. It helps you “develop and design UI components outside your app in an isolated environment”. Professional developers use it to build faster, more durable, and documented UIs.

Storybook is used by teams at Airbnb, Dropbox, Lonely Planet, IBM, and many more.

## Why a Storybook tutorial?

The tutorial aims to explain tried-and-true patterns for component development using Storybook. The techniques here are sourced from professional teams, core maintainers, and the awesome Storybook community.

Rather than trying to cover every edge case the tutorial recommends best practices. As such, it’s necessarily opinionated and some viable techniques may be ignored.

## Your skill level

It’s important that this tutorial is approachable to all skill levels. If you follow along, you’ll be able to build a UI in Storybook without issue. However, we do assume that you’re familiar with basic JavaScript, components, and web development.

If you already use Storybook, checkout the official docs for API documentation or visit the Chroma Medium for more articles on UI components.

**What you’ll learn**

1.  Setup and installation
2.  Build a simple components
3.  Assemble a composite components
4.  Work with container components
5.  Construct a screen
6.  Test UI components
7.  Deploy Storybook

## What you’ll build

Taskbox, a task management UI (similar to Asana), complete with multiple item types and states. We’ll go from building simple UI components to assembling composite components and screens. Each chapter illustrates a different aspect of developing UIs with Storybook.

## Commits

When wrapping up an idea you’ll get links to commits to help you stay in sync. The finished code is available on Github.
