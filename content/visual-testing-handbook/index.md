heroDescription: "Visual testing is a pragmatic yet precise way to verify the look of UI components. Itâ€™s practiced by companies like Slack, Lonely Planet, and Walmart. This 4 chapter handbook gives you an overview of visual testing in Storybook."
overview: "Visual tests capture an image of every UI component in a consistent browser environment. New screenshots are automatically compared to previously accepted baseline screenshots. When there are visual differences, you get notified. This helps developers ensure consistency and pinpoint UI bugs in ever more complicated modern UIs."

![Taskbox UI](/ss-browserchrome-taskbox-learnstorybook.png)

Taskbox, a task management UI (similar to Asana), complete with multiple item types and states. We'll go from building simple UI components to assembling screens. Each chapter illustrates a different aspect of developing UIs with Storybook.
