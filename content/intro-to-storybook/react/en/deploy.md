Throughout this tutorial, we've been focused on development on our development machine. At some point we'll want to deploy and share our Storybook with our team, especially with the non-technical members. Thankfully, it‚Äôs easy to deploy Storybook online.

## Exporting as a static app

To deploy Storybook we first need to export it as a static web app. This functionality is already built-in and configured for us, so we don't need to worry about any configuration.

When we run `yarn build-storybook`, it will output a static Storybook in the `storybook-static` directory. Which can be deployed to any static site hosting service.

## Publish Storybook

In this tutorial we'll be using <a href="https://www.chromatic.com/">Chromatic</a>, a free publishing service made by the Storybook maintainers, that allows us to deploy and host our Storybook safely and securely in the cloud.

### Get Chromatic

Add the package as a dependency.

```bash
yarn add -D chromatic
```

Once the package is installed, we'll need to [login to Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/start) with our GitHub account (Chromatic will only ask for lightweight permissions). Then we'll create a new project called name "taskbox" and copy the unique `project-token` generated for us.

  <source

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Now we can execute it, by issuing the following in the command line, to build and deploy our Storybook.

```bash
npx chromatic --project-token=<project-token>
```

<div class="aside">Don't forget to replace <code>project-token</code> with the unique project token generated by Chromatic.</div>

Once it finishes executing, we'll get our Storybook deployed online without the need of any additional setup. A link like `https://random-uuid.chromatic.com` will be provided for us. Once we open the link in a browser window we'll see a exact copy of our local Storybook that we've been working on.

At this point we were able to create a application, implement various types of tests and successfully setup and manually deploy our Storybook with some addons.

But couldn't we do better? Couldn't we automate this process?

The short answer is yes. We can automate this process with relative ease and that's what we'll do next.

### Setup a repository in GitHub

When our project was initialized in the [Get started chapter](/react/en/get-started/), Create React App (CRA) already created a local repository for us. At this stage it's safe to add our files to the first commit.

Issue the following commands to add and commit the changes we've done so far.

```bash
$ git add .
```

Followed by:

```bash
$ git commit -m "taskbox UI"
```

Once that's done, we can go to GitHub and create a new repository for our project [here](https://github.com/new). We'll name it ‚Äútaskbox‚Äù, same as our local project.

![GitHub setup](/intro-to-storybook/github-create-taskbox.png)

In the new repo we'll grab the origin URL of the repo and add it to ours with the following command:

```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<your username>/taskbox.git
```

Now we can finally add our files to our repository on GitHub with:

```bash
$ git push -u origin master
```

### Continuous deployment with Chromatic

So far we've seen how we could deploy our Storybook manually, but now that our project is hosted in a GitHub repository, how can we continue to deploy our Storybook and share it with our team?

GitHub has a solution for this, through a fantastic feature called [actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

And that's what we're going to implement next.

Once you‚Äôve set up the GitHub action. Your Storybook will be deployed to Chromatic whenever you push code. You can find all the published Storybook‚Äôs on your project‚Äôs build screen in Chromatic. You‚Äôll also get PR check when you open a PR that links directly to your published Storybook.

### Implementation of the GitHub action

In the root folder of our project, we'll need to create a new one called `.github` and inside it, create another one called `workflows`.

Once that's done we'll need to create a new file called `chromatic.yml` with the following content:

Don't forget to change `project-token` with the actual project token.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/chromatic.yml
# name of our action
name: 'Chromatic Deployment'
# the event that will trigger the action
on: push

# what the action will do
jobs:
  test:
    # the operating system it will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # the list of steps that the action will go through
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn build-storybook
      - uses: chromaui/action@v1
        # options required to the GitHub chromatic action
        with:
          # our project token, to see how to obtain it
          # refer to https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/react/en/deploy/
          projectToken: project-token
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # the name of the folder where Storybook will be exported into.
          storybookBuildDir: storybook-static
```

<div class="aside"><p>For brevity purposes <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">secrets</a> weren't mentioned. But is something that you and your team need to take into consideration when deploying Storybook with actions.</p></div>

And that's it, all is required is to commit and push the changes to our repository and we've successfully automated our Storybook deployment

This is helpful as a part of the standard app development process or simply to show off work üíÖ.
