# Setup Storybook and add assets
Storybook runs alongside your app in development mode. It helps you build UI components isolated from the business logic and context of your app.

We’ll need to follow a few steps to get the build process set up in your environment.  To start with, we want to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) to setup our build system, and enable [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) testing in our created app. Let’s run the following commands:

```bash
# If you haven't already got some tools we need, install from npm
npm install --global create-react-app getstorybook yarn

# Create our application:
create-react-app tasklist
cd tasklist

# Add Storybook:
getstorybook
```

We can quickly check the various environments of our application are working properly:

```bash
# Run the test runner (Jest) in a terminal:
yarn test
# Start the component explorer on port 9009:
yarn run storybook
# Run the frontend app proper on port 3000:
yarn start
```

Depending on what part of the app you’re working on, you may want to run one or more of these simultaneously. Since our current focus is creating a single UI component, we’ll stick with running Storybook.

## Reuse CSS
Taskbox reuses design elements from Meteor’s [Todos app](https://www.meteor.com/articles/todos-example-app), so we won’t need to write CSS in this tutorial. We’ll simply compile the LESS to a single CSS file and include it in our app. Copy and paste [this compiled CSS](https://gist.github.com/tmeasday/a2658f7c37ab93dfc03e688c0febdae0) into the src/index.css file per CRA’s convention.

If you want to modify the styling, the <a href="https://github.com/meteor/todos/tree/master/imports/ui/stylesheets" target="_blank">source LESS files</a> are provided in the Github repo.

## Add assets
We also need to add the font and icon [directories](https://github.com/meteor/todos/tree/master/public) to the public/ folder. After adding styling and assets, the app will render a bit strangely. That’s OK. We aren’t working on the app right now. We’re starting off with building our first component!
